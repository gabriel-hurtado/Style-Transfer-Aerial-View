Modification of the code to generate an Aerial view dataset artificially aged

The goal is to start from a dataset of Aerial Views, train the network with an old style, like explained in https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, then run CreateDataset.py with the created network and the desired dataset of pictures to convert to a different style.
